## The File System

The file system used in modern versions of Windows is the New Technology File System or simply NTFS(1).

Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System). 

You still see FAT partitions in use today. For example, you typically see FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards, etc. but traditionally not on personal Windows computers/laptops or Windows servers.

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

    Supports files larger than 4GB
    Set specific permissions on folders and files
    Folder and file compression
    Encryption (Encryption File System(1.5) or EFS)

If you're running Windows, what is the file system your Windows installation is using? You can check the Properties (right-click) of the drive your operating system is installed on, typically the C drive (C:\).

You can read Microsoft's official documentation on FAT, HPFS, and NTFS here(2). 

Let's speak briefly on some features that are specific to NTFS. 

On NTFS volumes, you can set permissions that grant or deny access to files and folders.

The permissions are:

Full control
Modify
Read & Execute
List folder contents
Read
Write

How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?

Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
From the context menu, select Properties.
Within Properties, click on the Security tab.
In the Group or user names list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.
In the below image, you can see the permissions for the Users group for the Windows folder. 

Refer to the Microsoft documentation to get a better understanding of the NTFS permissions for Special Permissions.

Another feature of NTFS is Alternate Data Streams (ADS).

Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System).

Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer(3) doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell(4) gives you the ability to view ADS for files.

From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.

Not all its uses are malicious. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that the file was downloaded from the Internet.

To learn more about ADS, refer to the following link from MalwareBytes here(5). 


## The Windows\System32 Folders

The Windows folder (C:\Windows) is traditionally known as the folder which contains the Windows operating system. 

The folder doesn't have to reside in the C drive necessarily. It can reside in any other drive and technically can reside in a different folder.

This is where environment variables, more specifically system environment variables, come into play. Even though not discussed yet, the system  environment variable for the Windows directory is %windir%.

Per Microsoft, "Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders".

There are many folders within the 'Windows' folder. See below.

The System32 folder holds the important files that are critical for the operating system.

You should proceed with extreme caution when interacting with this folder. Accidentally deleting any files or folders within System32 can render the Windows OS inoperational. Read more about this action here. 

Note: Many of the tools that will be covered in the Windows Fundamentals series reside within the System32 folder. 

## User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions

User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: Administrator & Standard User. 

The user account type will determine what actions the user can perform on that specific Windows system. 

An Administrator can make changes to the system: add users, delete users, modify groups, modify settings on the system, etc. 
A Standard User can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.
You are currently logged in as an Administrator. There are several ways to determine which user accounts exist on the system. 

One way is to click the Start Menu and type Other User. A shortcut to System Settings > Other users should appear. 

Since you're the Administrator, you see an option to Add someone else to this PC.

Note: A Standard User will not see this option.  

Click on the local user account. More options should appear: Change account type and Remove. 

Click on Change account type. The value in the drop-down box (or the highlighted value if you click the drop-down) is the current account type. 

When a user account is created, a profile is created for the user. The location for each user profile folder will fall under is C:\Users.

For example, the user profile folder for the user account Max will be C:\Users\Max.

The creation of the user's profile is done upon initial login. When a new user account logs in to a local system for the first time, they'll see several messages on the login screen. One of the messages, User Profile Service, sits on the login screen for a while, which is at work creating the user profile. See below.

Once logged in, the user will see a dialog box similar to the one below (again), indicating that the profile is in creation.

Each user profile will have the same folders; a few of them are:

Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Another way to access this information, and then some, is using Local User and Group Management. 

Right-click on the Start Menu and click Run. Type lusrmgr.msc. See below

Note: The Run Dialog Box allows us to open items quickly. 

Back to lusrmgr, you should see two folders: Users and Groups. 

If you click on Groups, you see all the names of the local groups along with a brief description for each group. 

Each group has permissions set to it, and users are assigned/added to groups by the Administrator. When a user is assigned to a group, the user inherits the permissions of that group. A user can be assigned to multiple groups.

Note: If you click on Add someone else to this PC from Other users, it will open Local Users and Management.
