## The File System

The file system used in modern versions of Windows is the New Technology File System or simply NTFS(1).

Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System). 

You still see FAT partitions in use today. For example, you typically see FAT partitions in USB devices, MicroSD cards, etc. but traditionally not on personal Windows computers/laptops or Windows servers.

NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

    Supports files larger than 4GB
    Set specific permissions on folders and files
    Folder and file compression
    Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)

If you're running Windows, what is the file system your Windows installation is using? You can check the Properties (right-click) of the drive your operating system is installed on, typically the C drive (C:\).
