## Accessing your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy)

### What is SSH & How does it work?

Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form. 
Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network -- where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine.

You can learn about the various types of encryption on a TryHackMe room. But for now, we only need to understand that:
      SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely.
      Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network such as the Internet

### Using SSH to login to your linux machine

The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:

1. The IP address of the remote machine
2. Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine

## More Commands

man < command > ; man ls   -> brings up the manual on how to use the ls command
ls -a                      -> gives light to hidden folders

touch <file name >         -> Creats file 
mkdir                      -> Makes Directory ( Folder )
cp                         -> Copy a file or folder
mv                         -> Move a file or folder
rm                         -> Remove a file or folder
file                       -> Determine the type of file

rm -r                      -> Allows you to remove folders
