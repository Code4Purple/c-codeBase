## Accessing your Linux Machine Using SSH (Deploy)

### What is SSH & How does it work?

Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form. 
Using cryptography, any input we send in a human-readable format is encrypted for travelling over a network -- where it is then unencrypted once it reaches the remote machine.

You can learn about the various types of encryption on a TryHackMe room. But for now, we only need to understand that:
      SSH allows us to remotely execute commands on another device remotely.
      Any data sent between the devices is encrypted when it is sent over a network such as the Internet

### Using SSH to login to your linux machine

The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:

1. The IP address of the remote machine
2. Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine

## More Commands

man < command > ; man ls   -> brings up the manual on how to use the ls command
< command > -- help        -> gives you the menu for that command 
ls -a or --all             -> gives light to hidden folders
ls -lh                     -> gives a list of permisions of all files in the directory


mkdir                      -> Makes Directory ( Folder )

touch <file name >            -> Creats file 
cp                            -> Copy a file or folder
mv                            -> Move a file or folder

rm                            -> Remove a file 
rm -r                         -> Allows you to remove folders

file                          -> Determine the type of file
cat  <file name>              -> prints out the contents of a file

su <user name>                -> Switchs users within the system
su <user name> *-l or login*  -> allows you to inherit alot more properties of the 
                                 new user like environment variables and the likes

sudo < Command >              -> Gives root permission to the commnad
sudo apt -install             -> allows you to install a package like git for example


## Briefly: The Differences Between Users & Groups

We briefly explored this in Linux fundamentals part 1 (namely, the differences between a regular user and a system user). The great thing about Linux is that permissions can be so granular, that whilst a user technically owns a file, if the permissions have been set, then a group of users can also have either the same or a different set of permissions to the exact same file without affecting the file owner itself.

Let's put this into a real-world context; the system user that runs a web server must have permissions to read and write files for an effective web application. However, companies such as web hosting companies will have to want to allow their customers to upload their own files for their website without being the webserver system user -- compromising the security of every other customer. 

We'll learn the commands necessary to switch between users below.
